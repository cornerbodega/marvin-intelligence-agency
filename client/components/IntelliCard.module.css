/* Here's a brief explanation:

The .image-wrapper is given a width (in this example, it's 100% of its parent, but it can be any width).
The padding-bottom: 100%; is the magic part. It gives the wrapper a height that's equal to its width, achieving a 1:1 ratio.
The image itself is then positioned absolutely within this wrapper and stretched to fill the wrapper completely. The object-fit: cover; ensures the image scales proportionally and doesn't get distorted.
This approach lets you keep the image in a 1:1 ratio, and the actual size will be determined by the layout or the width you set for the .image-wrapper. */

.imageWrapper {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%; /* or any other width you want */
  padding-bottom: 100%; /* This makes it 1:1 aspect ratio */
  overflow: hidden;
}

.imageWapper img {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
